Spotify doesn't have comments! This will be a webpage where you can add comments to any song as well as just see others reactions to that song.

Comments have a times seen, a times liked, and %liked (the second divided by the first). 

Each time a new viewer sees the page, comments are displayed in a consistent distribution. 

Some are well liked, some are not well liked and some are never liked. This provides an equal chance for every comment to have viewings, not just those that have been around for a while.
